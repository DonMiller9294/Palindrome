## Overview

Welcome to the Palindrome Checker project in Python! This repository contains a simple yet intriguing program that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome or not. Palindromes are sequences of characters that read the same forwards and backwards, such as "radar" or "level."

## Introduction

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "madam" and "racecar" are palindromes. In this Python program, we will build a palindrome checker that allows you to input a word or phrase and determines if it is a palindrome or not.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Palindrome Checker, you need to have Python installed on your local machine. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To check if a word or phrase is a palindrome, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/palindrome-checker.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd palindrome-checker`
3. Run the Python script: `python palindrome.py`

The program will prompt you to enter a word or phrase. Once you input the text, the Palindrome Checker will determine if it's a palindrome and display the result.

## Features

- Check whether a word or phrase is a palindrome.
- Easy-to-use and interactive command-line interface.
- Python program with simple and concise logic.
